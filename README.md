**Experience ID**: 130700367963690

# Available Scripts:
- Skip Loading.lua: Allows you to skip the loading screen when you connect to the experience. We measured the loading screen takes a whopping 72 seconds before letting you actually spawn in - which is valuable development time. Now, you can spawn in under 5 seconds.
- Rollback.lua: A patched exploit/vulnerability designed to allow the users data to **permanently** never save or get "rolled back" on server disconnect. Allows for the infinite duplication of items & cash. The "permanent" effect can be removed by simply discarding your character and creating a new one.

⚠️ Globals/utility functions are not provided and must be implemented yourself.

Please respect the license (AGPL-3.0 license). You're allowed to use, modify, and even sell as long as you comply with this license. It is the unfortunate reality that most people using Luau "cheat/hack" code are anywhere aged 12 to 22 who simply seek to steal & seek profit from public code, with blatant disrespect to the license & authors. Please don't do this. View the condition of the license [here](LICENSE).
